        <p>My dream is to become either a proffessional drummer or software engineer. I plan to
        achieve one of these careers by studying percussion and computer science.
        I want to go to college with these careers in mind as my majors so I can learn new ways
        to code and drum. The reason I chose to become either drummer or software engineer is because
        computers and music have always been my passions. I've always loved video games and websites like 
        Youtube and Netflix and have always loved to know how they were made. I've also always been interested 
        in music and drumming and so I couldn't decide between the two. </p>

        <p>I am naturally decent at drumming and I am able to adapt to new songs,  styles or drums. 
        I am known to be super social and energetic towards others, including students, and sometimes teachers. 
        Currently, I am practicing digitally, and I am learning new platforms such as OBS, 
        smart music, github and MAGIX Music Maker.</p>

        <p>Through practice and experience, I have learned to play all types of percussion decently and become really
        good at esports and building computers. Thanks for reading about me!</p>
