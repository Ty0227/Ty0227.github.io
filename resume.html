                    <ul>

                        to Coronado for a jazz festival in which I played drums. 
                        <li>I also played in multiple Fortnite solo and trio cash cups winning almost $800 in total from all events.

                <li>I can edit on Adobe Premiere and can make any type of video.
                    I also am really good at building computers.
                    Recently, I placed top 5 in a Fortnite trio cash cup and won $150.
                <li>I drum traditionally with drum sticks, but I have got a chance to play with brushes which make a softer sound.
            </ul></p>
